In case of two vectors:

--> Sorting based on the first element of each inner vector.

    sort(points.begin(), points.end())



--> If you want to sort based on a different element of the inner vector (e.g., the second element), 
    you would need to provide a custom comparator to std::sort. For instance:

    std::sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });
